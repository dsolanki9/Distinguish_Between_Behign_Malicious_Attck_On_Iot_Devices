# Distinguish_Between_Behign_Malicious_Attck_On_Iot_Devices
# Samsung is one of the companies that manufactures IoT devices for everyday use. There are several other companies which do the same such as Philips, Provision etc. Their products include cameras, doorbells, heat sensors and motion sensors. All of which can be helpful in local house security or disruptive for the same. A need is present for a monitory system which can detect malicious traffic in our everyday devices such as Security cameras, Doorbells, Thermostats even baby monitors. The problem here is that many companies are rushing out new IoT devices such as Doorbells and security cams without any said security systems. This leads to many small invasions of privacy and other extreme acts such as Identity Thefts.
# Our goal is to use network traffic as a base with our domain knowledge in Cyber Security and networking to combine it with data science and create a model which can accurately identify Malicious traffic over the said IoT devices.
